# Python-Proj
Hi, I took some python courses and these are some of the best projects I have created. It haven't really touched these files in a while so they are kinda basic.  If you care and you want to add extra and help edit you are welcome to do so.

#AI_begin.py
Sorry if the name is deceiving, I really don't know what to call it but it is a class called myAI that can beform some basic tasks it will tell you the date, play a game of russian roulette and give you a quote if you are down. I made a sign-in but I didn't store it so an acount has to be made every time you run it.

#num_to_word.py
Looking back at this I don't even recognize my own code but I remember going through a lot of mental stress to think about it but I am proud of it. I just want to store it here in case of anything bad
